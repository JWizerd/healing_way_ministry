# Healing Way Ministry
Dear Webmaster,

I hope you enjoy the website template that I have created for the church, this was a blast for me to make and helped me to progress my web design skillz. I wanted to write this README for you, since you will be managing this web design in the future. I believe it's important when shipping any product to have documentation for the user so they can have a smooth transition adapting to new technologies. Overall, I believe you will find the tools I have used in this project to be intriguing; possibly a new set of tools that you can emphasize in your next static web design project if you haven't already.

Sincerely,

####Jeremiah

## Specifications:

1. The website is ran using Jekyll: The Static Website Generator. Jekyll is a fantastic tool for creating lightweight, modular and "dry" static websites. **"Static"** meaning, non-database-driven. However, this does not mean that the site is not dynamically generated. The developers of Jekyll created a templating language, similar to ERB in Ruby OR PHP Template Tags with Wordpress, it is called **Liquid** and it allows you to do things that most static website don't such as data manipulation via data files (see the events page and the events.json file to get an idea of how content is being outputted), running processes via terminal and modularizing your content into different files called **includes**. To learn more about Jekyll and how it can make your life a heck of lot easier when it comes to managing a static website check out the Jekyll Docs https://jekyllrb.com/.
2. This site is using the GitHub Pages Ruby Gem for Custom Domain Hosting. GitHub, a version control system for managing OR versioning your code through different phases of development and production allows Jekyll websites to be **Hosted for FREE** for custom domains such as the currently active domain that the church is occupying. My plan is that you can transfer your domain hosting over to GitHub Pages and eliminate all costs for your website altogether (except for the annual domain renewal fee). This will require you to do a couple things. 1) install git on your operating system, create a GitHub Account https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRTckrrCME4 2) install jekyll on your operating system, there are a couple dependencies for this please read this information carefully https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ 3) initialize add and commit the repositories to your github account. From here you can set up GitHub Hosting using these steps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoQzIjGbfTg. Also, refer to this for setting up your custom domain. https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/
3. You can add events (to be continued...)
