# Healing Way Ministry
Hey Lucas,

It was a pleasure talking to you and getting a good overview of what your technology skill set is pertaining to web design so I could design this product with the best usability in mind. A couple things to keep in mind. I have created three separate accounts for you (soundcloud, google calendar and an account to handle donations). Since each of these accounts will house the functionality for the more dynamic parts of your website (events, sermons and donations) my hope is that this eliminate any need of custom changes to the website itself. However, if custom changes would like to be made I have provided some useful resources below that will help you understand the environment so you edit the HTML and CSS without breaking layout. If you do end up having questions please feel free to contact me :-)

Sincerely,

####Jeremiah

## Specifications:

- [bootstrap css framework](https://getbootstrap.com) this is the backbone for this entire layout so classes such .row, .container, .col-sm-12 etc. things like this are default bootstrap classes used to make modern developers lives easier. PLEASE do not remove these styles in the html as it will break the layout.

- [soundcloud media player](https://soundcloud.com/) this is the website that I have set up to manage the sermons on your website. To add sermons please login to soundcloud and add sermons rather than adding them directly in the html.

- [google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar) this is the third party app used for the upcoming events section of the website. Please login to google calendar to add events to the website.
